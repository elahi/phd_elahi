### Suggestions for evaluating temporal trends


1. Remove Dec 2007 to account for learning curve

2. 11 Dec 2008 
  - Echinoderms emphasized, don't use for species richness or diversity

3. 17 Sep 2011
  - ON1 - only measured Nucella on bottom half of transect, must estimate density per 2.5m2, not 5m2

4. 17 Mar 2012 (39523)
  - Only inverts were measured at the three sites due to time restrictions
  - At ON1, many more Nucella were not measured
