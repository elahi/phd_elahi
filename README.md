This is a repository for the ecological field data I collected during my PhD at the University of Washington. By archiving the raw data, and providing some metadata, I hope that these data can be useful by anyone (including myself!) in the future. 

Note that I am providing the raw data - not the data that were processed and analyzed in publications (see below). The tidied raw data can be found in the 'output' folder for each type of dataset: mobile fauna in quadrats, mobile fauna on transects, and sessile taxa in quadrats. 

See the pubs for descriptions of the field methods. 

This is a work in progress, so if you have questions, please contact me and I will update the repo as necessary.
